# TalkSpoon
TalkSpoon is a community-driven platform that aims to help users generate more engaging conversations with AI programs by providing a database of prompts. Our platform is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, and our prompts are contributed by the community and categorized by topic and use case.

Currently, TalkSpoon only supports the submission of prompts through GitHub pull requests. If you would like to contribute a prompt, please follow these steps:

Fork our repository on GitHub. Create a new branch for your prompt. Add your prompt to the appropriate category in the prompts directory. Submit a pull request. Once your pull request has been reviewed and merged, your prompt will be added to the TalkSpoon database and be available for others to use.

We believe that democratizing AI is an important step towards making technology more accessible and beneficial for all. By sharing your knowledge and creativity with the community, you can help us achieve this goal.

Thank you for your interest in TalkSpoon!
